--Objective:
--To explore patterns in billing amounts across hospitals, medical conditions, and admission types
--while identifying trends indicating higher costs for specific insurance providers and patient demographics.

SELECT *
FROM healthcare_1;

--1. Billing Patterns:

    --Which hospitals have the highest and lowest average billing amounts?

SELECT TOP 10 Hospital,AVG(Billing_Amount) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1
GROUP BY Hospital
ORDER BY Avg_Billing DESC;

SELECT TOP 10 Hospital,AVG(Billing_Amount) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1
GROUP BY Hospital
ORDER BY Avg_Billing ASC;

SELECT Hospital,AVG(Billing_Amount) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1
GROUP BY Hospital
ORDER BY Avg_Billing ASC;

    --How does billing vary by admission type (urgent, emergency, elective)?

SELECT Admission_Type, ROUND(AVG(Billing_Amount), 2) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1
GROUP BY Admission_Type
ORDER BY Avg_Billing DESC;

   -- Are there specific medical conditions associated with higher billing amounts?

SELECT Medical_Condition, ROUND(AVG(Billing_Amount), 2) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1
GROUP BY Medical_Condition
ORDER BY Avg_Billing

--2. Insurance Provider Analysis:

    --What is the distribution of billing amounts across insurance providers?
SELECT Insurance_Provider, ROUND(AVG(Billing_Amount), 2) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1
GROUP BY Insurance_Provider
ORDER BY Avg_Billing DESC;


--3. Demographic Trends:

    --Are there correlations between patient gender or blood type and billing amounts?

SELECT Gender, ROUND(AVG(Billing_Amount), 2) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1
GROUP BY Gender
ORDER BY Avg_Billing DESC;


SELECT Blood_Type, ROUND(AVG(Billing_Amount), 2) AS Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1
GROUP BY Blood_Type
ORDER BY Avg_Billing DESC;


    --Do older patients or specific demographics incur higher treatment costs? 

 SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN Age < 18 THEN Billing_Amount END), 2) AS Minor_Avg_Billing,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN Age BETWEEN 18 AND 65 THEN Billing_Amount END), 2) AS Adult_Avg_Billing,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN Age > 65 THEN Billing_Amount END), 2) AS Senior_Avg_Billing
FROM healthcare_1;

# Healthcare Data Cleaning and Analysis Project
**Overview**

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a healthcare dataset to explore patterns in billing amounts across hospitals, medical conditions, and admission types. The goal is to identify trends that indicate higher costs for specific insurance providers and patient demographics while ensuring the dataset is clean, standardized, and optimized for analysis.

**Objective**

To deliver actionable insights into healthcare billing patterns by:

  1. Cleaning the dataset to remove duplicates, standardize data, and ensure readability.
  2. Exploring billing trends across hospitals, admission types, and medical conditions.
  3. Analyzing insurance provider billing patterns and demographic trends, such as age, gender, and blood type.

**Purpose**

This project provides a comprehensive view of billing patterns in healthcare, enabling stakeholders to understand cost variations and make data-driven decisions to optimize billing processes and patient care.

**Insights**

  1. My analysis revealed that Hernandez-Mortin hospital had the highest average billing, suggesting a potential area for cost optimization or further investigation into its practices.
  2. Medicare, a federally funded program, has the highest avergae billing cost for all patients. This could potentially be due contracted agreements with hospitals and Medicare due to much of the cost of a patient's bill is covered by Medicare.
  3. Billing amounts tend to be highest for Obesity and Diabetes. This may not come as a surprise as these have been some of the most promoinent health issues for Americans within the last few decades.
